# nginx-subrequest-auth-jwt
This project implements a simple JWT validation endpoint meant to be used with NGINX's [subrequest authentication](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-subrequest-authentication/), and specifically work well with the Kubernetes [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) external auth annotations.

It validates a JWT token passed in the `Authorization` header against a configured public key, and further validates that the JWT contains appropriate claims.

## Limitations
The configuration format currently only supports a single elliptic curve public key for signature validation, and does not have a facility for rotating keys without restart. Basic support in the configuration format for supporting multiple active keys, and of different types, at once is in place but currently not used.

# Configuration
A number of flags affect how the service is started:

Flag     | Description | Default
---------|-------------|--------------------
  --help | Show help | -
  --config | Path to configuration file | config.yaml
  --log-level| Log level | info
  --tls-key | Path to TLS key | `<required>`
  --tls-cert | Path to TLS cert | `<required>`
  --addr | Address/port to serve traffic in TLS mode | :8443
  --insecure | Serve traffic unencrypted over http | false
  --insecure-addr | Address/port to serve traffic in insecure mode | :8080

## Configuration file
The service takes a configuration file in YAML format, by default `config.yaml`. For example:

TODO: update documentaion for `jwksUrl` validation keys are no longer needed and instead `jwksUrl` shoudl be used:
```yaml
jwksUrl: https://<<insert_openid_connect_host>>/.well-known/openid-configuration/jwks
#No longer working
validationKeys:
  - type: ecPublicKey
    key: |
      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
      ...
      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
claimsSource: static
claims:
  - group:
      - developers
      - administrators
```

With this configuration, a JWT will be validated against the given public key, and the claims are then matched against the given structure, meaning there has to be a `group` claim, with either a `developers` or `administrators` value.

Claims can either be statically set, as in the above example, or passed via query string parameters. The `claimsSource` configuration parameter controls which mode the server operates in, and can be either `static` or `queryString`. Further examples of the two modes are given below.

### Static

Multiple alternative allowed sets of claims can be configured, for example:

```yaml
validationKeys:
  - type: ecPublicKey
    key: |
      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
      ...
      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
claims:
  - group:
      - developers
      - administrators
  - deviceClass:
      - server
      - networkEquipment
```

In this case, the token claims **either** needs to have the groups as per the previous example, **or** a `deviceClass` of `server` or `networkEquipment`.

There can also be multiple claims requirements, for example:

```yaml
validationKeys:
  - type: ecPublicKey
    key: |
      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
      ...
      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
claims:
  - group:
      - developers
      - administrators
    location:
      - hq
```

Here, the token claims must **both** have the groups as before, **and** a `location` of `hq`.

### Query string
In query string mode, the allowed claims are passed via query string parameters to the /validate endpoint. For example, with `/validate?claims_group=developers&claims_group=administrators&claims_location=hq`, the token claims must **both** have a `group` claim of **either** `developers` or `administrators`, **and** a `location` claim of `hq`.

Each claim must be prefixed with `claims_`. Giving the same claim multiple time results in any value being accepted.

In this mode, in contrast to static mode, only a single set of acceptable claims can be passed at a time (but different NGINX server blocks can pass different sets).

If no claims are passed in this mode, the request will be denied.

# NGINX Ingress Controller integration
To use with the NGINX Ingress Controller, first create a deployment and a service for this endpoint. See the [kubernetes/](kubernetes/) directory for example manifests. Then on the ingress object you wish to authenticate, add this annotation for a server in static claims source mode:

```yaml
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: https://nginx-subrequest-auth-jwt.default.svc.cluster.local:8443/validate
```

Or, in query string mode:

```yaml
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: https://nginx-subrequest-auth-jwt.default.svc.cluster.local:8443/validate?claims_group=developers
```

Change the url to match the name of the service and namespace you chose when deploying. All requests will now have their JWTs validated before getting passed to the upstream service.

# Metrics
This endpoint exposes [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics on `/metrics`:

- `http_requests_total{status="<status>"}` number of requests handled, by status code (counter)
- `nginx_subrequest_auth_jwt_token_validation_time_seconds` number of seconds spent validating tokens (histogram)
